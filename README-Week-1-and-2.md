# Week 1 Assignment – Python Basics & Data Analysis Tools
Familiarised myself with pandas, numpy and matplotlib through their respective assignments.

# Week 2 Assignment – Time Series & Statistical Arbitrage

## Exercise 1 – Linear Regression 
- Performed simple linear regression of `mpg` on `horsepower`
- Interpreted regression output and confidence/prediction intervals
- Visualized the regression line and diagnostic plots

## Exercise 2 – Stationarity of USD/CAD
- Plotted daily closing prices of USD/CAD
- Tested stationarity of log-prices using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test
- Estimated the half-life of mean reversion using linear regression

## Exercise 3 – Mean Reversion Analysis
- Modeled price changes to estimate the speed of mean reversion
- Calculated the half-life of deviations under a mean-reverting assumption
- Evaluated the practical relevance of the half-life for short-term trading

## Exercise 4 – Pairs Trading: EWA & EWC
- Plotted daily prices of EWA and EWC ETFs and computed their correlation
- Estimated the hedge ratio using OLS regression
- Constructed the spread portfolio
- Tested spread stationarity using the ADF test
- Estimated the half-life of mean reversion for the spread
